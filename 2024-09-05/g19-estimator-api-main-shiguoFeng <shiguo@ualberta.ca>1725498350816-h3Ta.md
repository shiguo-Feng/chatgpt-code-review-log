# OpenAi Code Review.
### ðŸ˜„ Code Score: 90
#### ðŸ˜„ Code Logic and Purpose:
The `ItemService` class is responsible for providing services related to items, such as retrieving quotation details. It returns appropriate responses based on whether a quotation is found or not.
#### âœ… Code Strengths:
- The removal of the `System.out.println("test");` line eliminates unnecessary and unprofessional debug output in the production code.
- Proper usage of response models (`ResponseResult.okResult` and `ResponseResult.errorResult`) for handling different scenarios.
#### ðŸ¤” Issues:
- The removed `System.out.println("test");` was an unnecessary debug statement.
- No other apparent issues were identified in this particular diff.
#### ðŸŽ¯ Suggestions:
- No additional code changes are needed for the portion displayed.
#### ðŸ’» Modified Code:
```java
public class ItemService implements IItemService {
    // Method logic...
    if (quotation.isPresent()) {
        // Quotation found, return details
        QuotationVO quotationVO = createQuotationVO(quotation.get());
        return ResponseResult.okResult(quotationVO);
    } else {
        // Quotation not found, handle error
        return ResponseResult.errorResult(AppHttpCodeEnum.CONTENT_NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```
