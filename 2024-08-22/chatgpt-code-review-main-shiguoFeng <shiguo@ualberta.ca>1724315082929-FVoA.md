Upon reviewing the provided git diff for the `Discord.java` file, it appears that a line within the `sendLogMessage` method has been commented out. Below are my observations and suggestions:

### Observations:
1. **Commented Out Line:**
   - The line previously added a field "Author" to the embed object using data from `TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR`.
   - The line is now commented out with a C++-style comment (`//`).

### Potential Impacts:
1. **Loss of Information:**
   - By commenting out the line that adds the "Author" field to the embed, the information about who committed the change will no longer be included in the Discord message. This may be crucial data for understanding the context of the change.

2. **Maintainability:**
   - Commenting out code instead of removing it can lead to clutter, making the codebase harder to read and maintain. It's best to remove the line entirely if it's not needed.

### Suggestions:

1. **Justification:**
   - Ensure there is a clear reason for omitting the "Author" field. If this is for privacy reasons or due to data sensitivity, consider documenting the rationale in a comment block above the method, rather than using line comments.

2. **Alternatives:**
   - If the "Author" data could be beneficial but should not be shown directly, consider an alternative way to provide this information. For instance, sending it through another secure channel or logging it elsewhere.

3. **Code Cleanliness:**
   - If the removal is final, it is better to completely delete the line rather than leave commented-out code.

### Revised Code:
If the decision to remove the author field is final, the code should look like this:

```java
public class Discord {
    public void sendLogMessage(Map<TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey, String> data, String logUrl) {
        EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!", "link to log", logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
        embed.addField("Repository", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.REPO_NAME), true);
        embed.addField("Branch", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.BRANCH_NAME), true);
        embed.addField("Message", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_MESSAGE), false);
    
        templateMessageDTO.addEmbed(embed);
    }
}
```

### Documentation:
If you are removing the author field for a specific reason, document it properly within the code base or relevant documentation so that future maintainers understand the reasoning behind this change.

```java
/**
 * Sends a log message to Discord with details about a commit.
 * Note: Author field has been removed due to [reason].
 */
public void sendLogMessage(Map<TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey, String> data, String logUrl) {
    EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!", "link to log", logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
    embed.addField("Repository", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.REPO_NAME), true);
    embed.addField("Branch", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.BRANCH_NAME), true);
    embed.addField("Message", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_MESSAGE), false);
    
    templateMessageDTO.addEmbed(embed);
}
```

### Conclusion:
Ensure the change aligns with the project requirements and consider the long-term impact. Documentation and code cleanliness should always be a priority to maintain a readable and maintainable codebase.
