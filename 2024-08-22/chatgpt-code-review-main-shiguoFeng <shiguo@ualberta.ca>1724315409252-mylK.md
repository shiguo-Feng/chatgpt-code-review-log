Based on the provided `git diff` records, here is a review of the code changes:

### Change Summary:
The code change involves uncommenting a line that adds the "Author" field to an `EmbedObject` in the `Discord.java` file. The `EmbedObject` is presumably used to create a Discord message embed.

### Code Context:
Original Code:
```java
// embed.addField("Author", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR), true);
```

Modified Code:
```java
embed.addField("Author", data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR), true);
```

### Detailed Review:

1. **Uncommenting the Author Embed Field**:
   - The line of code that adds an "Author" field to the `EmbedObject` has been uncommented. This change means that the author's information will now be included in the embed message sent to Discord.

2. **Field Details**:
   - The `addField` method appears to be adding details to the embed object which is likely structured as:
     ```java
     embed.addField(String name, String value, boolean inline)
     ```
   - The `name` parameter is "Author".
   - The `value` is retrieved from `data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR)`.
   - The `inline` parameter is set to `true`, meaning the field will be displayed inline with other fields when rendered in Discord.

3. **Impact on Functionality**:
   - Including the "Author" field improves the informative value of the embed message by displaying who committed the changes.
   - Ensure that `data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR)` returns a valid and expected value, and that `TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR` correctly maps to the commit author's name in the `data` structure.

4. **Potential Issues to Watch**:
   - **Null or Empty Values**: Ensure that the `data` map always contains a valid string for the `COMMIT_AUTHOR` key. If the value could be null or empty, you might want to add validation or a fallback to prevent sending incomplete information.
   - **Length and Formatting**: Discord has character limits and specific formats for embed fields. Make sure the author's name adheres to these guidelines to avoid runtime errors or unexpected display issues.
   - **Error Handling**: If `TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR` is not properly defined or mapped, it can lead to `NullPointerException` or similar issues. Ensure robust error handling and logging.

### Recommendations:
To further ensure the robustness and quality of the code, I recommend the following:

1. **Add a Check for Null or Empty Author**:
   ```java
   String commitAuthor = data.get(TemplateMessageDTO.TemplateKey.COMMIT_AUTHOR);
   if (commitAuthor != null && !commitAuthor.isEmpty()) {
       embed.addField("Author", commitAuthor, true);
   } else {
       // Handle the case where the commit author is not available
       embed.addField("Author", "Unknown", true);
   }
   ```

2. **Unit Test**:
   If not already in place, add a unit test to cover this scenario. This test should verify that the "Author" field is correctly added to the embed when the author's name is available in the `data` map.

3. **Review Other Fields**:
   As you are making changes to embed fields, ensure that all other fields (`REPO_NAME`, `BRANCH_NAME`, `COMMIT_MESSAGE`) are correctly handled and validated in a similar manner.

By implementing these recommendations, you can ensure that the addition of the "Author" field is robust, enhances the functionality, and maintains the reliability of the code.
