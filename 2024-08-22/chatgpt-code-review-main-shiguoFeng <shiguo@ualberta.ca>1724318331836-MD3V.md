Let's review the provided code changes based on the git diff records:

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Discord.java**:
    - Modified the content of the `templateMessageDTO` to include a newline character at the beginning.
    - Removed the debugging lines that printed out the generated JSON and the log URL.
    
2. **ApiTest.java**:
    - Fixed a parsing error in `test()` by replacing an invalid integer string with a valid one.

### Detailed Review:

#### **Discord.java:**
```diff
-        templateMessageDTO.setContent("Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅");
+        templateMessageDTO.setContent("\nMission Accomplished: Code Review ✅");
```
- **Change**: Added a newline character at the beginning of the content.
- **Implication**: This change will add a newline in the message content, which could affect the formatting of the message in Discord. Make sure this change aligns with the desired message format in Discord.
- **Suggestion**: Test the message formatting on Discord to ensure it looks as intended.

```diff
-        // 打印生成的 JSON 以供调试
-        String jsonString = JSON.toJSONString(templateMessageDTO);
-        System.out.println("Generated JSON: " + jsonString);
-        System.out.println("Log Url: " + logUrl);
```
- **Change**: Debugging outputs have been removed.
- **Implication**: This will clean up the code and remove unnecessary console output. It is a good practice for production code, but these statements can be helpful during development or debugging.
- **Suggestion**: Consider using a logging framework with different log levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`). This way, you can still have the debug information without affecting the production environment by simply changing the log level configuration.

#### **ApiTest.java:**
```diff
-        System.out.println(Integer.parseInt("abc1234"));
+        System.out.println(Integer.parseInt("1234"));
```
- **Change**: Changed the string `"abc1234"` to `"1234"` in a test method.
- **Implication**: The original code would throw a `NumberFormatException` due to the non-numeric characters in the string. The new code correctly parses an integer string.
- **Suggestion**: Ensure test cases handle edge cases and unexpected inputs appropriately. If the intention was to test error handling for invalid numbers, consider using:
```java
try {
    System.out.println(Integer.parseInt("abc1234"));
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    System.out.println("Caught NumberFormatException: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### Conclusion:
Overall, the changes improve code cleanliness by removing debugging prints and fixing a test case. However, it's important to test the message formatting in Discord and consider using a more structured logging approach rather than removing debug statements outright.
