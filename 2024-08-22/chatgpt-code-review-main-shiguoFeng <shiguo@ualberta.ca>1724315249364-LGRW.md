Let's review the changes made in the `Discord.java` file based on the provided git diff record. The changes are minor but important to evaluate for potential impacts and improvements.

## Original Code:
```java
EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","link to log", null, 3066993); // Green color
```

## Modified Code:
```java
EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","link to log", "", 3066993); // Green color
```

### Analysis

1. **Change Overview**:
   The modification replaces `null` with an empty string `""` in the third argument of the `EmbedObject` constructor.

2. **Constructor Parameter Impact**:
   - Original: `new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","link to log", null, 3066993)`
     - If `null` is used, this typically implies that no value is provided or the absence of value is explicitly indicated.
   - Modified: `new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","link to log", "", 3066993)`
     - Using an empty string `""` explicitly indicates that a string value is intended but is currently empty.

3. **Potential Side Effects**:
   - **Null Handling**: Changing from `null` to an empty string might have different implications depending on how the `EmbedObject` class handles `null` vs. empty strings.
   - **API Validation**: If there is any API validation or logic that distinguishes between `null` and an empty string, this change could alter behavior.
   - **Downstream Processes**: Ensure that downstream processes or any logic that depends on this parameter properly accounts for empty strings.

4. **Code Consistency**: 
   - If the design of the `EmbedObject` class or intended functionality expects an empty string rather than `null`, this change improves clarity. However, if `null` was significant in some way (e.g., signaling an optional parameter), verify that this change is compatible with existing functionality.

### Recommendations:

1. **Review `EmbedObject` Class**:
   - Check how the `EmbedObject` class handles the third parameter.
   - Ensure that the logic in the class or methods still behaves as expected when receiving an empty string.

2. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Add or update unit tests to validate the behavior with an empty string.
   - Ensure no functionality is broken due to this change, particularly any conditional checks that distinguish between `null` and empty strings.

3. **Code Documentation**:
   - If not already present, document any relevant reasons why an empty string is preferred to `null` in this context.
   - Include comments in the code or in the commit message detailing why this change was made to provide clarity for future maintainers.

### Conclusion:

This is a minor but potentially impactful change. It's crucial to validate how the `EmbedObject` processes these values and ensure that downstream functionality behaves correctly. Proper testing and documentation will help ensure that this change improves code quality without introducing unintended side effects.
