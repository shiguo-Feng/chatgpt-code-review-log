### Code Review

#### Context
The changes are part of a system that integrates with Discord as part of a code review pipeline. The primary goal of the diff appears to be encoding the `logUrl` using `URLEncoder` and passing the encoded URL to an `EmbedObject`.

#### Summary of Changes
1. Added import for `URLEncoder`.
2. Encoded `logUrl` using `URLEncoder.encode` with `UTF-8`.
3. Passed the encoded URL to `EmbedObject` instead of the raw `logUrl`.

#### Review Points

1. **Import Statement:**
    ```java
    +import java.net.URLEncoder;
    ```
    Adding the `URLEncoder` is appropriate for URL encoding functionalities. The import is correct.

2. **Encoding `logUrl`:**
    ```java
    +String encodedLogUrl = URLEncoder.encode(logUrl, StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString());
    ```
    Using `URLEncoder.encode` to encode the `logUrl` ensures that any special characters in the URL are correctly formatted for use in a URL context. Using `StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString()` is also correct and preferred over hardcoding the charset as "UTF-8".

3. **EmbedObject Creation:**
    ```java
    -EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","", logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
    +EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","", encodedLogUrl, 3066993); // Green color
    ```
    Using the `encodedLogUrl` instead of `logUrl` in the `EmbedObject` is correct; this ensures that any special characters in the URL do not cause issues when displayed or processed in Discord.

#### Recommendations

1. **Error Handling:**
    While the code handles encoding correctly, it lacks error handling that might arise from `URLEncoder.encode`. Although unlikely, encoding errors should be caught and properly logged.

    ```java
    try {
        String encodedLogUrl = URLEncoder.encode(logUrl, StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString());
        EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","", encodedLogUrl, 3066993); // Green color
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        // Log this error
        logger.error("UnsupportedEncodingException when encoding logUrl: {}", e.getMessage());
        // Fallback to using raw logUrl
        EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","", logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
    }
    ```

2. **Code Readability and Comments:**
    Adding a comment to explain why encoding is necessary can improve code readability for future maintainers.

    ```java
    // Encode logUrl to ensure it is safe to include in the Discord embed
    String encodedLogUrl = URLEncoder.encode(logUrl, StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString());
    ```

3. **Unit Testing:**
    Make sure to update or add unit tests to cover the changes, especially ensuring that `logUrl` encoding is performed correctly and handle any edge cases that might arise.

4. **Potential Library Method**:
    Java 11 introduced `java.net.URI` with the `URI.create()` method which could potentially be used for URI validation and encoding. Consider switching to more recent and potentially more robust methods if you're working in a compatible environment.

Overall, these changes make the code more robust and prepare the `logUrl` for safe transmission, but incorporating the recommendations will make the solution more comprehensive.
