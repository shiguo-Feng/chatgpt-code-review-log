The code change you've shared involves a modification to a portion of `Discord.java`. Here's a closer look at the changes and a review:

### Original Line
```java
EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!", templateMessageDTO.getContent(), logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
```

### Modified Line
```java
EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!","link to log", logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
```

### Code Review:

1. **Content Change**:
   - **Original**: Uses `templateMessageDTO.getContent()` to dynamically set the second parameter of the `EmbedObject`.
   - **Modified**: The second parameter is statically set to `"link to log"`.

2. **Context**:
    - The second parameter of `EmbedObject` seems to be content or body text.

3. **Impact**:
    - **Original Code**:
      - The content of the embed message is dynamically filled with the template message content (`Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅`).
    - **Modified Code**:
      - The embed message content is now statically changed to `"link to log"`, which may lack the context or clarity the dynamic message previously provided.
    
4. **Suggestions**:
    - If the intention was to provide a more meaningful static message or improve the clarity, then ensure it fits the context of where this embed message will be presented.
    - Consider validating the necessity of this change with the team or stakeholders to confirm that replacing a dynamic message with a static one conveys the intended information adequately.

5. **Potential Improvements**:
    - If a static message is required but should remain dynamic in outlining the process step (like the original message), consider concatenating or formatting strings:
      ```java
      EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!", "Details available at: " + logUrl, logUrl, 3066993);
      ```
    - Alternatively, refine the template content to maintain the mission accomplished message along with the log mention.
      ```java
      String updatedContent = "Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅. Log details available [here](" + logUrl + ")";
      EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!", updatedContent, logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
      ```

The change, while minor, significantly impacts how the information is conveyed in your application. Ensure that the static message continues to fulfill the user's informational needs and context. If `templateMessageDTO.getContent()` is needed elsewhere or offers additional useful context, consider alternative ways to preserve that information.
