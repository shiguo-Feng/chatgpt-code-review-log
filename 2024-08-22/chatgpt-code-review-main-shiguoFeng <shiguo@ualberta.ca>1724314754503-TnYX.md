Let's review the changes made to the `Discord.java` file in the Git diff:

### Original Code:
```java
templateMessageDTO.setContent("**Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅**");

EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Commit Information", templateMessageDTO.getContent(), logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
```

### Updated Code:
```java
templateMessageDTO.setContent("Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅");

EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject("Check it Out!", templateMessageDTO.getContent(), logUrl, 3066993); // Green color
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Content Update in `TemplateMessageDTO`:**
    - Original: `"**Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅**"`
    - Updated: `"Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅"`

    The update removes the Markdown bold syntax (`**`). This will affect how the content is rendered when sent to Discord. Without the `**`, the text will no longer be bold.

2. **Title Change in `EmbedObject`:**
    - Original: `"Commit Information"`
    - Updated: `"Check it Out!"`

    This changes the title of the embed message to be more engaging, possibly to attract more attention.

### Implications of These Changes:
1. **Markdown Formatting Removal:**
    - Removing the `**` around the message content will render the message in a regular font style instead of bold. If the intent was to emphasize this text, this change might tone down its visual impact. 

2. **Title Change in Embed:**
    - Changing the title to be more informal and catchy ("Check it Out!") may be better suited for grabbing users' attention compared to the more neutral "Commit Information". However, this is subjective and context-dependent.

### Recommendations:
1. **Review Intent:**
    - Ensure that the removal of the bold formatting (`**`) aligns with the desired presentation on Discord. If the message needs to be emphasized, consider keeping or changing the Markdown to suit the desired emphasis (e.g., `_italic_` or `__underline__` if supported).
  
2. **Consistency in Titles:**
    - While the new title is more engaging, it's essential to maintain a balance between informality and clarity. Ensure that all messages retain a clear and professional tone if that is necessary for your users or organization.

3. **Unit Tests:**
    - If you have tests validating the content of the messages being sent to Discord, ensure they are updated to reflect the new changes.

4. **User Feedback:**
    - Consider gathering feedback from the users who receive these messages to ensure that these changes improve readability and engagement without causing confusion.

### Conclusion:
The changes made are relatively minor but affect the presentation of messages sent to Discord. Review the implications on UI and readability, and if they meet the requirements, the changes can be approved. If any adjustments are needed based on the points above, please make them accordingly.
