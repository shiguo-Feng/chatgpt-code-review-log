Here's a detailed review of the code changes:

### Part 1: Changes in `EmbedObject.java`

#### Observations

1. **Class Structure**:
   - The fields `color` and `fields` have been moved up in the class declaration.
   - The constructor and methods have been restructured to follow a more conventional ordering: constructors at the top, followed by methods.
  
2. **Duplication Removal**:
   - The previous code had duplicate declarations and initializations of `color`, `fields`, `EmbedObject` constructor, and the nested `Field` class.
   - These duplicates have been removed.
  
3. **Encapsulation**:
   - The previously declared inner class `Field` included `getName()`, `getValue()`, and `isInline()` methods, which are standard getters.

#### Recommendations

1. **Code Formatting and Organization**:
   - The restructuring and removal of duplication enhance readability and maintainability. This should be adopted as it reduces redundancy and potential errors.
   - Ensure that the imports in this file are organized. Unused imports should be removed to keep the import section clean.

### Part 2: Changes in `Discord.java`

#### Observations

1. **Field `url` Assignment**:
   - The assignment `templateMessageDTO.setUrl(logUrl);` was removed.
   
2. **Hardcoded Content**:
   - The line `templateMessageDTO.setContent("**Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅**");` was hardcoded instead of generating content dynamically.
   
3. **Embed Object Initialization**:
   - The initialization of `EmbedObject` now includes the `logUrl`, making it available in the `EmbedObject`.
   
4. **Field Addition**:
   - Fields such as "Repository", "Branch", and "Author" were added to the `EmbedObject`.

#### Recommendations

1. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Hardcoding content like `"**Mission Accomplished: Code Review ✅**"` makes the method less flexible. Ideally, the content should be generated or dynamically decided based on the context.
   
2. **Parameter Usage**:
   - Removing `setUrl(logUrl)` might be an intentional change, but make sure that `logUrl` is used wherever necessary to provide relevant context.

### Part 3: Changes in `ApiTest.java`

#### Observations

1. **New Test Method**:
   - A new test method `test_discord()` was added to test sending a message to Discord.
   
2. **Setting Up Data**:
   - The `data` map is populated with test values (repo name, branch name, commit author, commit message).
   
3. **Embed Object Creation**:
   - An `EmbedObject` is initialized and fields are added to it.
   - The embed object is added to the `TemplateMessageDTO`.

4. **HTTP Request**:
   - A POST request is made to a Discord webhook URL with the generated JSON content.
   - Error handling is added to print out the error response if the response code is >= 400.

#### Recommendations

1. **Sensitive Information**:
   - Ensure the webhook URL (`web_url`) is not hardcoded in the test or production code. This should be configurable via environment variables or configuration files.
   
2. **Assertions**:
   - Add assertions to validate the response code to ensure the test verifies the expected behavior. Currently, it only prints the response.
   
3. **Test Data Cleanup**:
   - If possible, mock the HTTP connection for unit tests to avoid sending actual requests and to allow for more controlled testing scenarios.
   
4. **Error Handling**:
   - While the error handling is good for debugging, consider adding more structured error handling to properly log and deal with different kinds of errors.

#### Final Thoughts

Overall, the changes bring about a more structured and maintainable codebase. The removal of duplicates and the addition of new functionality in the test case are positive changes. Some areas could be improved with better dynamic handling, proper configuration management, and more robust testing practices.
